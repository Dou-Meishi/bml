Seperate the batch size M from eqaution classes. 
perhaps the number of time intervals N needs further consideration too.

Maybe M is best suits in ResCalcMixin

Here is the reasones

- The definition of SDE doesn't care about the sample size M.

- Usually, only when it comes to a proper discrete numerical scheme,
  then we need the number of time intervals N.
